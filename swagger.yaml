info:
  description: |
    This API specification describes a service for attaching, mounting and preparing container images and manipulating those containers.

    In general, higher level objects can either reference lower level objects (e.g. a mount referencing an attachment point) by a reference ID, 
    or, they can contain the full specification of those lower objects.

    If an object references another by ID, deletion of that object does not effect the underlying object.
    
    If an object defines a lower level object, that lower level object will automatically be deleted on deletion of the higher level object.

    For instance, if a container contains all of the defintions for all mount points and attachments, deletion of the container will automatically unmount
    and detach those lower objects.

          Currently known kinds:

          iscsi - attach an iscsi lun
          local - create an attachment reference to an existing block device (specifying a non-block device will fail)
          loopback - create a loopback device referencing a file in a mount
          rbd - attach a Ceph/RBD object

          All kinds may or may not be fully supported by the implementation.

  mount_attach:
    description: |
      `mount_attach` describes an attach mount.  This must have at least attach ID associated with it, 
      and a provided filesystem type.
      
      Either `attach_id` or `attach` must be specified.  If both are specified, `attach` will be ignored.

      If `attach` is specified and `attach_id` is omitted, the specified attach will first be attached, and will be
      detached on deletion.

  mount_overlay:
    description: |
      `mount_overlay` describes an Overlayfs mount.  All mount points must be RBD ID's.
      At very least, `lower` must be specified.  If `upper` length is zero, no `upper`
      mounts will be used.  `workdir` will be assigned automatically.

      If the mounts specified in `lower` are specifications and not ID references, they
      will be recursively mounted/attached.

      Overlay mounts are identified by their uppermost `lower` ID.

  mount_bind:

      base:
        description:  |
          base determines the relative root for the path.  There are two options:
          `root` means to use the current root (`/`) as the base path.
          `mount` means to use a mount as the base path. If this is specified, `mount` must be specified as well.

      If no `mount_id` is supplied a defition of type `kind` must be present.

          bind - bind mount a local directory
          nfs - mount an NFS filesystem
          overlay - overlay mount over an existing mount

      The `container` option describes a minimally namespaced container.

      A container is identified by a service-provided unique numeric `pid`.
